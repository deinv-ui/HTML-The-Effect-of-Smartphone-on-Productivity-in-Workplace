  <p>The popularization of smartphones in this decade has significantly increased, there are more and more people spending their time on smartphones. This phenomena results in a <b>great change</b> of behavior pattern in the society as smartphones are gradually overlapping with our lives. 
There were some <u>problematic smartphone uses</u> observed among young peoples, typically aging from <b>14 - 24 years old.</b> Issues include <b>constantly checking their smartphones for notifications, feeling phantom vibration from their smartphones, and feeling discomfort if smartphones are not around or out of batteries.</b> Research also states that there is a connection between smartphones and mental diseases such as <i>anxiety, depression, OCD, ADHD and alcohol use disorder.</i></p>
  
   
  <h2> <div class="iconsize"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></div>Relevance</h2>
  <p>The term ‘smartphone addiction’ is not widely agreed by the mainstream medical community, they prefer to define it as <b>problematic and compulsive behaviour.</b> <b><u>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR)</u></b> is a definitive guide from the <b>American Psychiatric Association’s (APA)</b> with contributions from more than 200 subject matter experts. In the manual they did not list smartphone addiction as an addiction or mental disorder. The truth is, people are not addicted to smartphones, they are addicted to the social connection, information and entertainment that smartphones bring.
</p>
 
   
   <h2> <div class="iconsize"><i class="fa-solid fa-bullseye"></i></div>Objectives</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of smartphones on productivity. The research will distinguish the determinants through the dispersion of surveys to the public. </p>
