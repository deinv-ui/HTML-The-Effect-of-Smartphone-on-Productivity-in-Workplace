<h3>
What is your opinion on Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) policies?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>I think the policy is good as it saves a lot of cost for the company although some data privacy might not be protected.</li>
	<li>I think bringing my own device has its benefits as it is more powerful than the pc my workplace can provide.</li>
	<li>Yeah, I can say that's a good idea. It's easier for them to do any activities at their work.</li>
	<li>Employees can bring their own devices such as smartphones and tablets anywhere and anytime easily. However, they may not want to get notifications all the time from their company.</li>
	<li>In my opinion, I would prefer the BOYD policy because I think we will feel more comfortable while using their own devices. It would be very stressful if we use someone's belongings. What if we accidentally damaged it, compensation is necessary.</li>
	<li>I think it's very useful because it can save costs in purchasing or renting devices for each employee.</li>
	<li>It is good because workers can be more flexible at work and can increase productivity.</li>
	
 </ul>
