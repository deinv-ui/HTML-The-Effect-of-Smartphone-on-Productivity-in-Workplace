			<h2 class="subtitle">Have You Ever Wonder HOW They Influence Our life POSITIVELY? </h2>
		
				<p>No worries-- here we are to offer some insights to you about all the advantages of smartphone, just like all the other things in the world, all have prons and cons.
				</p>
				
				
							<h3 class="subheading"> Easier Communication</h3>
				
						
							<p>First of all, smartphones are an important tool nowadays as it has become a widely available smart-device. Smartphones have <b>cheaper prices and higher portability</b> than computers, so it is welcomed by the public, especially in lower income countries. The versatility of smartphones also helps in everyday life. Basic functions like <b>calls </b>and <b>messages </b> allow easier communication between peoples, allowing people to exchange and share information easily. </p>
						
						
						
				
					
					
					
							<h3> Easier to obtain information</h3>
				
						
						
							<p>Smartphones come with a camera which can be used to take pictures and videos. Although the camera built on smartphones is not comparable to a <i>traditional camera</i>, smartphones still have a great advantage as it is more <b>portable </b>than traditional cameras. Smartphones also simplify the process of taking pictures by <i><b>automating the adjustment of parameters,</b></i> this lowers the operation threshold and allows more people to record their life & precious moments <b>easily.</b>
</p>
						
						
						
				
					
							<p>Another obvious advantage of smartphones is the ability to <b>access the internet remotely.</b> <b><i>Cellular</i> data</b> has greatly enhanced the usefulness of smartphones, allowing us to access the internet anywhere and anytime. The Internet has provided us with limitless possibilities on smartphones, the wide available applications on smartphones is the best proof to this. The applications ranging from <u>group chat, online meeting, online banking, e-commerce, search engine, navigation,</u> the possibilities are endless.
							</p>
						
						
						
							<h3> Increase Productivity</h3>
				
						
							<p>Besides, smartphones also have productivity applications like <b>Microsoft Office series, CAD and painting apps</b>. Some may argue that a computer can do such tasks with more efficiency, but the advantage of smartphones is its mobility. Smartphones are not comparable to keyboard and mouse, but it is more than enough to deal with these tasks when you have emergency needs and do not have a computer around. In addition to that, there are <b>specialized applications</b> like piano tuning app, e-medical illustrated collection, which are specially designed for professionals to help in their work.

			<h2 class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 100px;">On the other hand, DO you know HOW smartphone affects us NEGATIVELY?</h2>
		
				
				</p>
				
				
							<h3 class="subheading"> Eye diseases</h3>
				
						
					
							<p>Using smartphones for a long period of time could damage our eyes causing problems like nearsightedness <i>(myopia).</i> Many researchers have found the relationship between <b>natural light</b> and <b>myopia.</b> A sufficient amount of outdoor activities and natural light could help in preventing myopia. For example, an increase of outdoor activities time from <b>40 to 80</b> minutes can reduce myopia prevalence by <b>23% to 50%.</b> Since the popularization of smartphones, some parents have left smartphone parenting their kids because they are busy. Together with <b>heavy homework</b> from school, more and more children are getting nearsighted as they do not have <u>enough outdoor activities. </u>
</p>
						
						
						
							<h3> Mental Health</h3>
				
						
							<p>The mental problem caused by smartphones is also an issue we always neglect. The wide application of recommendation algorithms on many apps on smartphones can have a huge impact on us. A common effect of this is the information cocoon because the algorithm only recommends <b>what we are interested in.</b> The information cocoon will slowly distort our values and amplify our prejudices. For instance, the public's definition of beauty has gradually assimilated. On <i>Tiktok</i> and <i>Instagram,</i> slim has become the <u>prerequisite of beauty,</u> as a result some girls have led to malnutrition due to constant dieting. The pursuit of beauty also leads to various extremes such as <b>anorexia nervosa.</b>
</p>
						
						
						
							<h3> Smartphone Addiction</h3>
				
						
							<p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Moreover, algorithms also play an important role in smartphone <b>“addiction”</b>. As an example, popular apps like <b>Tik Tok and Facebook</b>, their algorithm traps user’s attention by constantly providing new and interesting content to the user. The mechanism is very similar to behavioral addiction like <i>gambling</i> and it was especially effective against kids and teenagers. Kids and teens had spent an increasing amount of time on smartphones instead of focusing on their studies and work.
