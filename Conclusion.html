 <h1>Conclusion</h1>
 <br>
 <h2>The study is conducted to find out the <b><i>Effect of Smartphones on Productivity.</i></b> </h2>
 <p>In the survey, most of the people (59.2%) states that smartphones affect their productivity, while the other part (40.8%) states that smartphones do not affect their productivity. Most people (42.7%) use smartphones for 8 and more hours daily, there are also 33% of people using smartphones for 5 to 6 hours daily. Most people (57.3%) use smartphones for 3 hours and above during work, and 35% of the people use smartphones for 1 hours and below. All of the respondents (100%) state that smartphones are essential to their work.

<p>It can be concluded that smartphones affect workplace productivity negatively even though they are essential to work. The usage of smartphones daily can prove that there were some problematic smartphone usage behaviour present in the groups of students. Other than that, the high usage of smartphones during work is also problematic, as smartphones can distract the user's attention. 
</p>
<p>
To reduce smartphone usage daily, students can develop other hobbies to replace playing smartphones. Some measures and regulations can be introduced to limit the usage of smartphones during work or learning, this could help people with low self-control in controlling their smartphone usage during work. </p>
