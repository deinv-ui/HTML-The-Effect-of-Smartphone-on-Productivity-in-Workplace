	<p id="intro-section">A total of <b>103</b> responses are collected through the questionnaire. The gender of respondents are <b>practically equal, </b>as 51 people (50.5%) are male, 49 people (49.5%) are females. The age of the respondent ranging from 18 to 24. Out of 103 responses, 77 people (74.8%) are students, 18 people (17.5%) are at work,  8 people (7.8%) are part time. 
<br><br>
	
For the question, how many years since you started using smartphones? <br>103 of the respondents (100%) have used smartphones for <u>more than 5 years.</u> Combined with the result above, it shows the <b>importance of smartphones </b>in this era of information and the popularity of smartphones among the youngsters. 
<br>
<br>
For the question, how many hours do you use smartphones per day? <br>44 people (42.7%) use smartphones for 8 hours or above daily, 18 people (17.5%) use smartphones 7 - 8 hours daily, 34 people (33%) use smartphones 5 - 6 hours daily, 7 people (6.8%) use smartphones 3 - 4 hours daily.This indicates smartphones have become <b>a part of life</b> among teenagers, because <b>more than half </b>of the respondents (60.2%) use smartphones <u>more than 7 hours daily.</u> Problematic smartphone usage behaviour can be observed within this result.
<br>
<br>

For the question, what is your most frequently used application type? <br>78 responses (75.7%) are Social Media, 73 responses (70.9%) are communications, 63 responses (61.2%) are video streaming, 34 responses (33%) are work / education, 31 responses (301.1%) are video games. Every respondent can choose <b>at most 3</b> frequently used applications in this question. 

<ul style="margin-left: 60px;">

<li>Social media is the <u><b>most</b> popular</u> application type, this shows that people are focused on <u>social interactions. </u>
Communication comes next after social media, since it is the core and basic function of smartphones. </li>
<li>Video streaming applications are also a popular choice, this is due to the <b>popularization</b> of <u>short videos</u> and improvement of recommendations algorithms. </li>
<li>Work / education applications are<u> <b>not</b> a popular choice,</u> this may be caused by the lack of creativity and innovations of such applications on smartphones. There are no great improvements to the old mode of work and education, the applications just move it to smartphones and make it online. With no improvements of efficiency and no great differences, people tend to prefer the old fashioned ways.</li>
<li>Video games are not a popular choice, this is due to the hardware limitations of smartphones and the lack of quality games that developed on smartphone’s plattform.</li>

</ul>
<br>
<br>
For the question, how much time you use smartphones during work? <br>34 people (34%) use smartphones for 4 or more hours during work, 25 people (24.3%) use smartphones for 3 hours during work, 8 people (7.8%) use smartphones for 2 hours during work, 28 people (27.2%) use smartphones for 1 hour during work, 8 people (7.8%) did not use smartphones during work. The results show that the <u>smartphone usage during work</u> is quite<b> high,</b> two explanations can be formed to explain this result. Firstly, smartphones are an essential tool in people’s work, different work also have <b>different dependency </b>on smartphones. Secondly, <u>the misuse of smartphones</u> is happening during the <b>work hours,</b> as people vary in self-control in using smartphones.
<br>
<br>
For the question, do smartphones affect your productivity?<br>
 61 people (59.2%) state that smartphones affect their productivity, 42 people (40.8%) state smartphones do not affect their productivity. The result is <b>very close</b> to the question above, where high usage of smartphones during work hours <b>distracts attention and reduces productivity.</b>
 
 <br>
<br>
For the question, do you think smartphones are essential to your work? <br>
 103 people (100%) agree that smartphones are essential to their work. This result suggests smartphones have brought <b>many conveniences</b> to us and become an <b>important part </b>of our modern lives.
 <br>
<br>
For the question, what is your opinion on the Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) policies?<br>
 Most of the respondents agree with the BYOD policies. This result is due to <b>personal privacy issues</b> and the <u><b>familiarity with self-owned devices.</b></u>
